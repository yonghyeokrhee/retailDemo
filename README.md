# Retail Demo Store Workshops

There are several interactive workshops delivered as Jupyter notebooks that are designed to walk a technical audience through incrementally adding functionality to the Retail Demo Store application or to demonstate how to integrate with AWS services or AWS partner platforms. These workshops can be completed on your own in your own account or delivered in a group event/workshop setting.

When the Retail Demo Store project is deployed to your AWS account, a SageMaker Notebook instance is also deployed with the Retail Demo Store workshops. To access the workshops in your AWS account, follow these steps.

1. Login to your AWS account where the Retail Demo Store was deployed. See [README](../README.md) for deployment instructions. If you're attending an AWS-led event/workshop, this has likely already been done for you.
2. From within your AWS account, browse to the SageMaker service page.
3. Under Notebooks, you should see a notebook instance with a name based on the stack name you used when deployed via CloudFormation. Open the instance in Jupyter or Jupyter Lab. If you don't see a notebook instance for the Retail Demo Store, be sure that you're in the right region.
4. Within Jupyter/Jupyter Lab, navigate to the [Welcome.ipynb](Welcome.ipynb) notebook to begin.
