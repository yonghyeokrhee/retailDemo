    "# Welcome to the Retail Demo Store Workshops\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshops in this project are designed to walk you through incrementally adding functionality to the base Retail Demo Store application. Some of the workshops build on each other so it is recommended to follow the workshops in order unless otherwise instructed as part of an organized event or workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT: The workshops are implemented using Jupyter notebooks that are designed to be executed from a SageMaker Notebook instance in an AWS account where the Retail Demo Store has been deployed. Therefore, the notebooks may not be fully functional outside AWS such as on your local machine. The Retail Demo Store's deployment templates will create the SageMaker Notebook instance and preload the workshop notebooks for you.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retail Demo Store Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Before opening and walking through the workshops, let's get familiar with the Retail Demo Store architecture and infrastructure deployed into your AWS account. Establishing this foundation will make the workshops more understandable and relatable back to the functionality being enhanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the Retail Demo Store is a polyglot microservice architecture deployed as a collection of RESTful web services in [Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) (ECS). Several AWS managed services are leveraged to provide build, deployment, authentication, messaging, search, and personalization capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Retail Demo Store Architecture](./images/retaildemostore-architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Microservices\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Web UI** container service (located in ECS rectangle in the above diagram) is used to provide the user interface for the Retail Demo Store. It uses the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) JavaScript framework for UI components, [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to communicate with back-end web service APIs, and [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) to integrate with [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) for authentication and [Amazon Pinpoint](https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/) for capturing user behavior and clickstream data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Users**, **Products**, **Carts**, and **Orders** web services provide access to retrieving and updating each respective entity type. These services are built with the [Golang](https://golang.org/) programming languge and provide very basic implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Search** service leverages [Amazon Elasticsearch](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/) to power user-entered product queries. The first workshop walks you through creating and populating the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Recommendations** service provides user and related product recommendations and personalized ranking of products. In its default launch state, the service lacks the ability to provide personalization. The second workshop steps you through how to use [Amazon Personalize](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/) to activate the personalization capabilities in the Recommendations service.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support Services\n",
    "\n",
    "Retail Demo Store's microservices and workshops make extensive use of [AWS Cloud Map](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/) to discover the private addresses of microservices and [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html) to store and discover important system configuration values that effect how the services behave. For example, once the Amazon Personalize campaigns are built in the Personalization workshop, the ARNs are saved as SSM Parameters that the Recommendations microservice uses to retrieve recommendations from Personalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to explore these services in the AWS console as you work through the workshops to see how they're utilized by the Retail Demo Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build and Deployment Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Retail Demo Store uses [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) to automatically build and deploy the microservices when a change is detected in the code repository (AWS CodeCommit or GitHub).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you deployed the Retail Demo Store via a linked GitHub repository (in which case you already have access to the source code), you can view all source code for the Retail Demo Store's microservices and notebooks in the [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/) Git repositories deployed in this AWS account.\n",
    "\n",
    "## User Interface Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Retail Demo Store was deployed in your account by CloudFormation, a load balancer was created that can be used to access the Web User Interface service. The CloudFormation template provides the URL of the load balancer as an Output parameter. Browse to the CloudFormation console in this AWS account, click on the Retail Demo Store's stack, then on the \"Outputs\" tab, and finally locate the key named \"WebURL\". Open this URL in a separate web browser tab/window.\n",
    "\n",
    "![CloudFormation Outputs](./images/cfn-webui-outputs.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you access the WebURL you should see the Retail Demo Store home page.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Retail Demo Store Home Page](./images/retaildemostore-home.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create Retail Demo Store User Account\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Access Create Account\n",
    "\n",
    "Click the \"Sign In\" button and then the \"Create account\" link on the sign in view.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Retail Demo Store Create Account](./images/retaildemostore-create-acct-link.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Complete New Account Form\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete all fields and be sure to use your actual mobile phone number, if possible, so that you can receive an account confirmation code via SMS. The user create and confirmation process is provided by Amazon Cognito. If you don't receive the SMS or had to use a fake phone number, you can manually confirm your user account by browsing to Amazon Cognito in this AWS account then select User Pools > Users, find your user and confirm.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Retail Demo Store Create Account](./images/retaildemostore-create-acct.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Confirm Account\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you receive your confirmation code from Cognito via SMS, enter it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Retail Demo Store Confirm Account](./images/retaildemostore-confirm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Sign In to Your Account\n",
    "\n",
    "![Retail Demo Store Sign In](./images/retaildemostore-signin.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Emulate Shopper\n",
    "\n",
    "The Retail Demo Store provides the ability for you to emulate one of the existing shoppers in the system. This is useful when you want to test the product and search personalization capabilities (after the search and personalization workshops are completed).\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on your user name in upper right corner and then click on Profile to access the Profile page.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Retail Demo Store User Profile](./images/retaildemostore-user-menu.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To emulate a shopper, select a shopper from the drop down and click \"Save Changes\". Once saved, you can browse the storefront. This will be covered in more detail in the workshops.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Retail Demo Store Emulate Shopper](./images/retaildemostore-emulate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Each workshop is implemented as a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open each notebook and follow along by reading and executing the cells sequentially. Use the \"run\" (\">\") button at the top of the notebook page to execute each cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Jupyter Notebook Play](./images/notebook-play.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Search Workshop](./0-StartHere/Search.ipynb) will walk you through the process of creating an index in Amazon Elasticsearch and loading the index with information on the products in the Retail Demo Store. The Retail Demo Store's Search service uses this index to perform queries based on user-entered search terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Open Workshop](./0-StartHere/Search.ipynb)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Personalization Workshop\n",
